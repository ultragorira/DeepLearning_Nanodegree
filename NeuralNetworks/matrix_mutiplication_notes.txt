The number of columns in the left matrix must equal the number of rows in the right matrix.
The answer matrix always has the same number of rows as the left matrix and the same number of columns as the right matrix.
Order matters. Multiplying A•B is not the same as multiplying B•A.
Data in the left matrix should be arranged as rows., while data in the right matrix should be arranged as columns.

You can safely use a transpose in a matrix multiplication if the data in both of the original matrices is arranged as rows.
